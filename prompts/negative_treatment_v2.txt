Extract all negative treatments (such as overruled, criticized, questioned, or limited) of other cases from the following court opinion.
For each, return a JSON object with the following keys: 'treated_case', 'treatment', 'treatment_text', and 'explanation'.
For 'treatment_text', include the full, direct quote from the opinion (do not use ellipses or summaries).
If none are found, return an empty JSON array [].

Limitations: 
1. Ensure that cases classified as `negative treatments` do not merely state that a certain party has requested a case to be
distinguished or overruled, but only include cases that are actually overruled, criticized, questioned, or limited.
`The State requests that we overrule our holding...` is not necessarily a negative treatment
unless the decision satisfies the state's request and expressly overrules it.

Limitation #1 Negative Example:  `Nonetheless this court declines to overrule 
the holding in ...`

Limitation #1 Positive Example: `We agree with the state's conclusion...`

Example:
[
  {
    "treated_case": "Smith v. Jones, 123 U.S. 456",
    "treatment": "Criticized",
    "treatment_text": "The court in Smith v. Jones, 123 U.S. 456, was criticized for its reasoning on this point.",
    "explanation": "The opinion explicitly criticizes the reasoning in Smith v. Jones."
