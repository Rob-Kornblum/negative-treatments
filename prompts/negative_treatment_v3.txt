Extract all negative treatments (such as overruled, criticized, questioned, or limited) of other cases from the following court opinion.
For each, return a JSON object with the following keys: 'treated_case', 'treatment', 'treatment_text', and 'explanation'.
For 'treatment_text', include the full, direct quote from the opinion (do not use ellipses or summaries).
If none are found, return an empty JSON array [].

Limitations: 
1. Ensure that cases classified as `negative treatments` do not merely state that a certain party has requested a case to be
distinguished or overruled, but only include cases that are actually overruled, criticized, questioned, or limited.
`The State requests that we overrule our holding...` is not necessarily a negative treatment
unless the decision satisfies the state's request and expressly overrules it.

Limitation #1 Negative Example:  `Nonetheless this court declines to overrule 
the holding in ...`

Limitation #1 Positive Example: `We agree with the state's conclusion...`

Limitation #2: Do NOT classify a case as negatively treated if it is cited to support the court's reasoning for overruling, criticizing, questioning, or limiting another case or doctrine. Only classify a case as negatively treated if the court explicitly disagrees with, limits, criticizes, or overrules that specific case.

Limitation #2 Negative Example:
"In our view, the Doctrine is more likely to have the effect of disrupting family harmony rather than preserving it. Hack v. Hack, Pa.Supr., 495 Pa. 300, 433 A.2d 859, 866 (1981)."
(Here, Hack v. Hack is cited to support the court's reasoning, not criticized or limited.)

Do not include Hack v. Hack in the output for this example.

Limitation #2 Example Output:
[]

Limitation #2 Positive Example:
"We disagree with the reasoning in Smith v. Jones and therefore limit its application."
(Here, Smith v. Jones is actually limited.)

Before including a case as negatively treated, double-check that the court is not merely citing it as support for its own reasoning or for overruling another case. Only include cases where the court explicitly disagrees with, limits, criticizes, or overrules that specific case.

Only include cases in the output that meet the above criteria. Do not include cases that are merely cited as support.

If no cases are explicitly overruled, criticized, questioned, or limited, or if all cited cases are only used as support, return an empty array: []

For each cited case, first determine: Is the court disagreeing with, limiting, criticizing, or overruling this case? Or is the court citing it as support? Only include the case if the answer is the former.

Example:
[
  {
    "treated_case": "Smith v. Jones, 123 U.S. 456",
    "treatment": "Criticized",
    "treatment_text": "The court in Smith v. Jones, 123 U.S. 456, was criticized for its reasoning on this point.",
    "explanation": "The opinion explicitly criticizes the reasoning in Smith v. Jones."
  }
